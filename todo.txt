There are points in the maze, marked by signs. Every turn you have a

1 / ( (n-3)^2 + 1 )

chance of getting a point if you're standing on one, or some similar formula. Basically there's always a chance, and it's optimal for one person. I might make it slope off a little less drastically for the masses... Perhaps

1 / ( |n-3| + 1 )

So there's a 100% chance w/ 3 people, 50% w/ 2 or 4, 33% by your lonesome, etc.

These points change every so often. And by "every so often" I mean, say, the framerate? 200 steps?

Make sure you tell them when they're rewarded.
Increase the map size.
Make sure the signs are legible.
Print out person densities.

Reward amount should probably be on the order of age per step * 1.5?
